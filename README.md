# Fake_News_Prediction
This project uses machine learning to classify news articles as real or fake. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a Logistic Regression model to analyze news content and predict its authenticity.
Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset, merges relevant fields, handles missing values, and applies stemming.
Text Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.
Model Training: Trains a Logistic Regression classifier to distinguish between real and fake news.
Evaluation: Measures model accuracy on both training and test data.
Prediction System: Allows users to input news content and receive a prediction on its authenticity.
